## Description :books:
- Today's modern apps are expected to deliver up-to-date information without hitting a refresh button. Add real-time functionality to your dashboards, maps, games and more.
- What is real-time functionality? It's the ability to have your server-side code push content to connected clients as it happens, in real-time.

### What can you do with ASP.NET and SignalR ? :bulb:
- While chat is often used as an example, you can do a whole lot more. Any time a user refreshes a web page to see new data, or the page implements Ajax long polling to retrieve new data, it's candidate for using SignalR.
- SignalR also enables completely new types of applications that require high-frequency updates from the server, such as real-time gaming.
